# DataStrcutures-Java

You are given a GeometricObject abstract base class. Create three new classes (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle) that inherit from this abstract base class. The constructors should be as follows:

1.Rectangle should take the lengths of the width and the height

2.Circle should take the radius

3.Triangle should take the length of the three sides
The constructors should throw a RuntimeException if the values passed are incorrect. These concrete classes should also implement the getArea and getPerimeter function.
